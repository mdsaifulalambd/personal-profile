            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <P>Web development or any other job is not to get it done by any chance by the end of the day. Any task should be coded smartly optimized. Too many lines of codes, though perform the task, not the real work skill. Like the father of the software giant, Microsoft, Bill Gates says “Do not hire a programmer who writes too many lines of code” says it all.</P>
